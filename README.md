The Aim on this project is to create a quote generator


The arrays are structured as the English Grammar are structured, piece by piece. This arrays would be enhanced adding some other pieces of the English grammar but for this project these would be ok :P

The project recall on this order the JS files
  -The Arrays (this file arrays.js)
  -The Quote Object (quoteObject.js)
  -The generator and extra code (quotegen.js)
